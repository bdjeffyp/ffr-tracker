# Yet Another Final Fantasy Randomizer Tracker

Found online at [https://bdjeffyp.github.io/ffr-tracker](https://bdjeffyp.github.io/ffr-tracker)

This tracker is based on ItsSupercar's A Link to the Past tracker, using the base design to create a tracker for Final Fantasy Randomizer.
Major changes include the use of React and TypeScript for development.

## INSTALLATION

This is a browser-based tracker. You can simply open index.html directly to begin using it. Or if you prefer, you can host it on a web server or your machine's localhost.

**NOTE:** Google Chrome does not allow local files to save cookies, so if you wish to use Chrome, the tracker will not remember your settings unless you save it to a host and navigate to it there.

## GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS

###### BASIC USE

- Before starting your game, check the flags to see what items you have initially. For example: if you have a Free Bridge at the start, click on the icon for the bridge.
- When you find an item, click its icon in the tracker. If you make a mistake and click the wrong icon, simply click it again.

## GOAL-SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS

###### SHARD HUNT (COMING SOON):

- This changes the ORBs/Crystals section of the tracker to Shards.
- Check the number of required shards to find from your flag set. Click on the +/- icons to match the flag with the number of shards. If the flag is for variable number of shards, you can set the required amount when you check the menu in-game for the first time.
- Click on the shard icon to change the number of shards found by one. Right-click to reduce the count by one (in case you made a mistake).
- You can visually tell how close you are to getting all required shards as the shard becomes brighter.

###### CHAOS RUSH/FREE ORBS:

- This simply checks off the Lute as found before starting your game. The hover prompt reminds you that the Key is not required to be found for the Temple of Fiends Revisited.
- Clicking on the Free ORBs/Crystals checkbox will check off the ORBs as found before starting your game as well.

## OPTIONS

Click the icon in the bottom left to open up the options menu.

- **GOAL:** Which variation of the game you're playing. Toggle Free ORBs on if that flag is set.
- **ERA:** Do you prefer the NES-style graphics and names or the later GBA/PSP release? Choose Modern or NES to make the tracker appear as if it were from those eras!
- **LAYOUT (COMING SOON):** Choose between a few different arrangements for the item tracker. Currently only Square layout is available. The plan is to also use tall and wide layouts and toggle if everything in within one frame or separated by category.
- **MAPS (COMING SOON):** Choose how the map is positioned, or turn it off.
- **TIMER:** Show/hide the timer's tracker.
